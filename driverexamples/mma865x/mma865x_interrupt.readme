Overview
========
The MMA865x Interrupt example application demonstrates the use of the MMA865x sensor in Non-Buffered Mode with Interrupts.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers reguired to put the sensor in Non-Buffered Mode, enable Interrupts and read out samples.

The sensor reads samples and then an Interrupt is raised (Pin is set high).
The application waits for the Interrupt signal and when received reads out the sample.
