Overview
========
The MMA865x Freefall example application demonstrates the use of the MMA865x sensor to detect freefall.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers reguired (including FF_MT) to put the sensor into Freefall detection mode and read detection events.

When the sensor detects freefall it sets a Flag.
The application consistently checks the Flag and when set, displays a message stating Freefall has been detected.
