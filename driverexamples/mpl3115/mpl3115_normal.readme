========
The MPL3115 Normal example application demonstrates the use of the MPL3115 sensor in the Normal (Non-Buffered) Mode.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers reguired to put the sensor into Standard Mode and read out a Pressure+Temperature sample.

The sensor reads samples as per the configured Auto acquisition time step and sets a Flag.
The application consistently checks the Flag and when set reads out the sample.
