The FXAS21002 SPI example application demonstrates the use of the FXAS21002 sensor using SPI in the Poll (Non-Buffered) Mode.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers reguired to put the sensor into Standard Mode and read out a sample.

The sensor reads samples as per the configured ODR and sets a Flag.
The application consistently checks the Flag and when set reads out the sample.
