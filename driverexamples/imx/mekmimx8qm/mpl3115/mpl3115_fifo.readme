Overview
========
The MPL3115 FIFO example application demonstrates the use of the MPL3115 sensor in Buffered (FIFO) Mode.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers reguired to put the sensor in FIFO Mode and read out Pressure+Temperature samples.

The sensor reads samples as per the configured Auto acquisition time step and are buffered upto the configured Water Mark Level and then a Flag is set.
The application consistently checks the Flag and when set, reads out all(count=Water Mark Level) samples.
