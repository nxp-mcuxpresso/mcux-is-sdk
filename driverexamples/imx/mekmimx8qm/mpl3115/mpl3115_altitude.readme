Overview
========
The MPL3115 Altitide example application demonstrates the use of the MPL3115 sensor to read Altitide instead of Pressure.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers reguired to put the sensor into Altitude mode and read Altitude+Temperature samples.

The sensor reads samples as per the configured Auto acquisition time step and sets a Flag.
The application consistently checks the Flag and when set reads out the sample.
