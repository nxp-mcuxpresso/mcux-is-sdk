Overview
========
The MPL3115 One-Shot example application demonstrates the use of the MPL3115 sensor in the One-Shot (on demand sampling) Mode.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers reguired to put the sensor into One-Shot Mode and read out a Pressure+Temperature sample.

The sensor reads samples when it is requested by the host then and sets a Flag.
The application then checks the Flag and when set reads out the sample.
