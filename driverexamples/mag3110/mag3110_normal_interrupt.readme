Overview
========
The MAG3110 Normal Interrupt example application demonstrates the use of the MAG3110 sensor in the Normal Mode with Interrupts.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers reguired to put the sensor into Standard Mode and read out a MagneticField sample.

The sensor reads samples as per the configured Auto acquisition time step and then an Interrupt is raised (Pin is set high).
The application waits for the Interrupt signal and when received reads out the sample.
