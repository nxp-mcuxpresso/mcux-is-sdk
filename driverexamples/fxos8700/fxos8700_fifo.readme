Overview
========
The FXOS8700 FIFO example application demonstrates the use of the FXOS8700 sensor in Buffered (FIFO) Mode.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers required to put the sensor in FIFO Mode and read out samples.

The application consistently checks for the FIFO status flag and reads out all(count=Water Mark Level) samples when it sets.
