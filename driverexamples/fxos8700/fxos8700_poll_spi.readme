Overview
========
The FXOS8700 SPI example application demonstrates the use of the FXOS8700 sensor in the hybrid(Accel + Mag) mode using SPI interface.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers required to put the sensor into hybrid mode and read out samples via SPI.

The application consistently checks for the data ready flag and reads out the sample when it is ready.
