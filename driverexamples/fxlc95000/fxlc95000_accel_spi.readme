Overview
========
The FXLC95000CL Intelligent, Motion-Sensing Platform is a device with the integration of a 3-axis MEMS accelerometer and a 32-bit ColdFire MCU.
This environment allows users with widely varying and growing functional requirements the ability to add user-specific functionality to the system.

A software framework hosted on the FXLC95000CL provides a common, easy to use interface which empowers users to quickly develop hardware-independent, portable, real-time application code.
This framework is named the Xtrinsic Intelligent Sensing Framework (ISF).

The FXLC95000L Accelerometer SPI example application demonstrates the use of the FXLC95000L as an Accelerometer in SPI Mode with ISF1P195K GetAccelDataWithCI is running on 32-bit ColdFire MCU.

The example demonstrates all commands reguired to put the sensor into Active Mode and read out Accelerometer samples.
The Accelerometer reads samples as per the configured ODR and updates the output mailbox registers.
The application reads out samples when its ODR Timer expires.
