Overview
========
The MPXV5004DP Interrupt example application demonstrates the use of the MPXV5004DP analog sensor with in ADC.
The example demonstrates configuration of ADC0 and LPTMR0 reguired to get the Pressure Sample and read out samples at periodic intervals.

The sensor constantly provides analog volatage output based on the perceived pressure differential.
The application configures LPTMR with the desired ODR and the ADC for voltage conversion and sends the CPU into wait mode.
The LPTMR periodically triggers ADC to read the voltage and convert it into a value.
Once the ADC completes conversion, it raises an interrupt and the application wakes up and displays the Pressure.
