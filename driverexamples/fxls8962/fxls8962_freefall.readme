Overview
========
The FXLS8962 Freefall example application demonstrates the use of the FXLS8962 sensor to detect freefall.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers reguired (including SDCD) to put the sensor into Freefall detection mode and read detection events.

When the sensor detects freefall it sets a Flag.
The application consistently checks the Flag and when set, displays a message stating Freefall has been detected.
