Overview
========
The FXLS8962 Normal Interrupt example application demonstrates the use of the FXLS8962AL sensor in the Normal (Non-Buffered) Mode with Interrupts.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers reguired to put the sensor in to Standard Mode, enable Interupt and read out a sample.

The sensor reads samples as per the configured ODR and then an Interrupt is raised (Pin is set high).
The application waits for the Interrupt signal and when received reads out the sample.
