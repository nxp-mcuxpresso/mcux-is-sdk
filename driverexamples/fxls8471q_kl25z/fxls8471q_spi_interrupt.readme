Overview
========
The FXLS8741Q Interrupt example application demonstrates the use of the FXLS8741Q sensor in interrupt mode.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers required to put the sensor in a interrupt mode and read out a sample via spi.

The application waits for the interrupt signal and read the sample when interrupt is asserted.
