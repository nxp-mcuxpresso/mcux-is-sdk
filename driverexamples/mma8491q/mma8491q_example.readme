The MMA8491Q example application demonstrates the use of the MMA8491Q sensor.
The example demonstrates how to put the sensor into Active Mode and read XYZ samples and Tilt output from the sensor.

The sensor reads samples as per the acquisition time and sets a Flag in the status register.
The application consistently checks the Flag after Turn On period and and when set reads out the sample.
