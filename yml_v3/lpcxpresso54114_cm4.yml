      brief: The freeRTOS Sensor Fusion example for LPCXpresso54114 with FRDM-STBC-AGM01
        sensor shield board demonstrates advanced functions for computation of device
        orientation, linear acceleration, gyro offset and magnetic interference based
        on the outputs of NXP inertial and magnetic sensors. The sensor fusion algorithms
        combine the x, y and z outputs from each of an accelerometer, magnetometer
        and gyroscope sensor.
