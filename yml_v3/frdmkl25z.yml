      brief: The MPL3115 FIFO example application demonstrates the use of the MPL3115
        sensor in Buffered (FIFO) Mode.The example demonstrates configuration of all
        registers reguired to put the sensor in FIFO Mode and read out samples.The
        sensor reads samples and are buffered upto the configured Water Mark Level
        and then a Flag is set.The application consistently checks the Flag and when
        set, reads out all(count=Water Mark Level) samples.
