Overview
========
The FXLS8952 Free-fall Interrupt example application demonstrates the use of the FXLS8952 sensor to detect free-fall with Interrupts.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers reguired (including SDCD) to put the sensor into Free-fall detection mode, enable Interrupts and read detection events.

When the sensor detects free-fall an Interrupt is raised (Pin is set high).
The application waits for the Interrupt signal and when received displays a message stating Free-fall has been detected.
