Overview
========
The FXLS8952 FIFO Interrupt example application demonstrates the use of the FXLS8952 sensor in Buffered (FIFO) Mode with Interrupts.
The example demonstrates configuration of all registers reguired to put the sensor in FIFO Mode, enable Interrupts and read out samples.

The sensor reads samples and are buffered upto the configured Water Mark Level and then an Interrupt is raised (Pin is set high).
The application waits for the Interrupt signal and when received reads out all(count=Water Mark Level) samples.
